Language Basics

This repo stands to ramp-up new comers to any programming language with the syntax and basic operations.
Any language (human or machine) has basic elements Keywords, Operators, Grammar. These elements combine to do operations. The operations could be direct (done by oneself) or indirect (initiated by self completed by others). The set of steps you need to take (action) is nothing but a series of instructions which form a code line (sentence).

While descriptive, not accurate can be improved the intention of this is to allow a complete beginner get a mindset, hang for fast paced ramp-up with the basics before he/she moves to the more advanced lessons/tutorials where a patterns and architectural decisions differentiate your coding abilities from the group.
